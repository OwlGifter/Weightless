# Weightless
Game Jam 2025 - Created Using Godot

The Game is based on anubis getting sick and tired of his job and getting a random soul(YOU) to do his job for him,
us the information you have on the souls to ask them questions and check if they are hiding something, or 
if they simply forgot due to old age, beware, mess up too many times and Anubis will have Ammit eat you.
